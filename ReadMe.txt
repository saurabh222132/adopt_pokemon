This is an application that simulates a virtual Pokemon adoption scenario. The app should allow users to:

* Register and log in.
* View available Pokemon for adoption (each Pokemon has different attributes like breed, age, health status, etc.).
* Adopt a Pokemon (Each user can adopt multiple Pokemon, but each Pokemon can be adopted only once).
* Once a Pokemon is adopted, the user can feed the Pokemon (each feeding increases Pokemon's health status).
* If a Pokemon isn't fed for a certain time (ex: 24 hours), its health status decreases.
