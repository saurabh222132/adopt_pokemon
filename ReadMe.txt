This is an application that simulates a virtual Pokemon adoption scenario. The app should allow users to:

* Register and log in.
* View available Pokemon for adoption (each Pokemon has different attributes like breed, age, health status, etc.).
* Adopt a Pokemon (Each user can adopt multiple Pokemon, but each can be adopted only once).
* Once a Pokemon is adopted, the user can feed it and see their dashboard (each feeding increases the Pokemon's health status).
* If a Pokemon isn't feeding for a specific time (ex: 24 hours), its health status decreases.

> More details about the app is in the mention in the demo application.
